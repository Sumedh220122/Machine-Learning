    The score was calculated based on log-loss metric

3. This project was a part of the hackathon that was conducted as a part of the course "Machine intelligence" by my university.
   The problem was to classify the data into various genres of music subject to various conditions
   The model scored a score of 0.86586 on the public leaderboard as well as on the private leaderboard
   The score was calculated based on "mean-squared-error" metric

4. This project is an analysis on the dataset which was a part of the "Spaceship Titanic" competition run by kaggle:
   The task was to predict the surival of passengers who were deported to another planet subject to various factors

   The task was to predict the surival of passengers who were a part of the titanic ship crash subject to various factors
   The model scored a score of 0.77124 on the public leaderboard as well as on the private leaderboard

6. This project was a part of the hackathon that was conducted as a part of the "Data-Analytics" course by my university
   The problem was to predict the "Close" values of stock prices given the "Open" and "Volume" prices.
   It was a time-series data and the task was also to predict whether the customers must buy,hold or sell the data.
